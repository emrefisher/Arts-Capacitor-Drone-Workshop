# Arts-Capacitor-Drone-Workshop


Built upon the open-source "Bitcraze Crazyflie" drone platform. Used radio-positioning nodes to triangulate the drone's position. Created a Web App that took a user-generated flight-path and exported a CSV file. Python script that read in CSV values and communicated with squadrons of drones to follow individualized flight paths.
